Implementation Details:
mem_init(): use mmap to create a new region of memory mapping. Then build two different datastructures for slab allocator (25% of region) and nextfit allocator(75% of region).

mem_alloc(): allocate memory using slab allocator and nextfit allocator.

mem_free(): free alloated memory. After freeing a chunk memory, coalesce it to aviod fragmentation.

mem_dump: print out memory status for debug.

thanks!
